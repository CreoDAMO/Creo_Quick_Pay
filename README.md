2. Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the `.xcworkspace` file. This will ensure that both the backend and frontend components are loaded correctly.

3. Configure the Backend:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory inside the project folder.
   - Install any necessary dependencies using a package manager like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.
   - Open the `backend.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
   - Configure your preferred database and payment processor settings in the appropriate files.
   - Build the backend project to ensure all dependencies are resolved and the project compiles successfully.

4. Run the Backend:
   - Choose the appropriate backend target scheme from the scheme dropdown menu in Xcode's toolbar.
   - Select the desired simulator device or connect a physical device.
   - Press Command + R (or select Product > Run) to build and run the backend.
   - Xcode will launch the backend server and display the console output.

5. Configure the Frontend:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory inside the project folder.
   - Install any necessary dependencies using a package manager like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.
   - Open the `frontend.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
   - Update the necessary configuration files to connect to the running backend server (e.g., API endpoints, server URLs).

6. Run the Frontend:
   - Choose the appropriate frontend target scheme from the scheme dropdown menu in Xcode's toolbar.
   - Select the desired simulator device or connect a physical device.
   - Press Command + R (or select Product > Run) to build and run the frontend.
   - Xcode will install and launch the app on the selected device, connecting it to the running backend server.

Now you should have the Creo Quick Pay backend and frontend running using Xcode. You can explore and test the features of the application within the Xcode simulator or on a physical device.
